# ANNPostProcessing
This software is used for post processing after finding the values weight and bias. You can draw Neural Network and by importing the parameters, you can find next value. Currently two activation functions are available (Relu and Sigmoid). You can find mean and standard deviation if you input data was normalized. This version is only for single input data.
